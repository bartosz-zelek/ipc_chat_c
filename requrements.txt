# file created as preparing for description of protocol and give some tips to team members
1. Config file
    1.1 All names in config file must be alphanumeric.
        1.1.1 The exception is colon (':') in sections' names.
    1.2 File must end with new line character ('\n').
2. Code
    1.1 When function msgsnd or msgrcv is used always use with it some if which checks returned value (usually -1)
    1.2 When function msgsnd is used then from number of sending bytes include substraction sizeof(mtype)
    1.3 Main queue to server is used for login purposes only (for now)
    1.4 Private queue is created for every logged in user and its id is pid of client's process
3. Login
    1.1 Client is sending credentials to server in the main queue (mtype=PROT_LOGIN)
    1.2 Server checks if credentials are valid and send a SuccessResponse in the main queue (mtype=pid of specific client) with success equal to 0 or 1
    1.3 If server comunicates with client about some specific action e.g. checking list of logged in users, they must differentiate request and response (there is possibility, that one procces would send and get the same data)
